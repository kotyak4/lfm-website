<p>Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of anomalous (up to 1978), hydrodynamics (up to 1982, fluid mechanics (1991), which was created to search for the most relevant scientific and practical problems and their active participation in the decision, from the beginning was built as experimental and theoretical .'s own experimental base, equipped with modern equipment, significantly increased the efficiency of research.
</p>
<p>
The creation of abnormal fluid mechanics laboratory and supervised all the active life in it worked fine, mathematically trained experimenter Vitaly Kalashnikov, who graduated and Petrochemical Institute. Gubkin and the Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University named after MV University. A major focus of research has been the effect of reducing friction in Newtonian fluids (water and kerosene, in particular), small additions of high-molecular substances. Created a number of experimental units, which examined the effect of polymers on the flow in the pipes of constant and variable cross-section, as well as on the vortices (Carman, Taylor-Taylor Safmena, Kalashnikov-Tsiklauri), and traces of the jet. We studied the possibility of turbulent drag reduction and noise reduction in the flow of bodies (external and internal problems), the management of heat and mass transfer, improved oil recovery, increasing destruction of abrasive solids, increasing Throw fire installations. The laboratory became the head by the introduction of new methods of studying the trends - hot-wire and laser Doppler probes.
</p>
<p>In the late 70's started to become particularly relevant questions hydroaerodynamics environment. There was a change of subjects and in the laboratory headed by Professor (now the Academy of Sciences), AI Leontiev began studies stratified according to the density of liquids, the first phase mainly theoretical. For the development of the experimental base, on the recommendation of academician SA Christianovich, 1981 at the Institute of VNIIFTRI was invited by Dr. YD Chashechkin.
</p>
<p>In the laboratory were established and continuously improved stands for the study of internal waves, multicomponent convection, compact vortex, vortex systems, streams, trails and other types of flows. The main instruments were selected high-sensitivity imaging devices shadow home development (IAB-451, IAB-458, IAB-463), with accompanying mono-and bistatic sonar, contact temperature meter, conductivity, speed of sound of its own design and produced in collaboration with the other institutions.
</p>
<p>Gradually been set up booths to simulate stratified flows, including hydrooptical pools of different sizes and accessories. Units are equipped with modern control experiment, collecting and presenting measurement data, which will link to a single individual stands Hydrophysical complex. Efforts to complete it regularly supported by grants from the Ministry of Education and Science, the Bureau of Sciences, Department of Energy, Engineering, Mechanics and Control Processes, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Federal Property Fund.</p>
<p>
Hydrophysical complex GFK IPM RAS is designed to study the effects of rotation and stratification analysis of the fine structure of the flow of heterogeneous fluids. It includes a number of large-scale hydro-optical pools with high quality optical illuminators, allowing to obtain interferograms and shadow patterns of flows. The pools are equipped with individual imaging systems, the contact temperature meter, conductivity, speed of sound, speakers mono-and bistatic sonar, laser remote gauges surface waves; computer systems for experiment control and data processing, specialized support mechanisms and devices to tow models, create different types of streams. The system includes a device for the experiments create a stratification of the specified type and the direct measurement of the profile of a period of buoyancy. For technical capabilities, completeness technique that combines optical, acoustic, and local contact instruments reached characteristics of the complex does not have a domestic and foreign counterparts.
</p>
<p>The complex allows us to study the dynamics and structure of inertial, surface, internal and acoustic waves, compact vortices and vortex systems, thermal, and multi-component concentration of flows, as well as bursts, jets, tracks with different coefficients of similarity.
</p>
<p>The complex provides the following specifications:</p>
<p>Operating environment: water, aqueous solutions stratified mineral salts, transparent solutions of organic substances.</p>

<p>The range of simulation parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The period of buoyancy: 3-30 s, as well as homogeneous liquid;</li>
<li>Velocity models: 0.0001-3 m / s;</li>
<li>The dimensions are: 0.01-0.3 m</li>
<li>The relative error in measuring the period of buoyancy - not more than 3%.</li>
<li>The relative error of measurement of physical fields (velocity, density, temperature) - not more than 5%.</li>
<li>The resolution of optical instruments - better than 0.1 mm.</li>
<li>The spatial resolution of contact sensors - better than 1 mm.</li>
<li>The spatial resolution of the acoustic channel - better than 2 mm.</li>
<li>Operating frequency sonar - 1 MHz.</li>
<li>Software Environment Data - Matlab.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the pools is equipped with a unique hydro-optical shadow instrument (BIA-451, IAB-458, IAB-463), modified for the registration of optical disturbances in stratified water solutions - environments with large variations of the density gradient. Mono-and bistatic sonar include low-inertia control system transmission and reception of signals, providing a cut-off of parasitic and other sources of sound and precise localization of the scattering region. Contact gauges are equipped with additional devices to control stratification and dynamic calibration directly in the experimental conditions.
</p>
<p>Support allows you to improve the experimental basis, to expand research topics. In recent years, study the mechanisms of mass transfer for different types and sizes. Created new stands for the study of vortex flows with torsion and microcurrents.</p>

<p>The research work is organized in close cooperation with universities (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, MIPT, Moscow State University, Moscow State Technical University. Bauman). Since 1997, the Laboratory operates branch of the Department of Physics of Sea and Inland Water Physics Department of Moscow State University (Head - Prof. KV Pokazeev). In 2009, at the suggestion of the Dean of the Physics Faculty of the Moscow State University professors V.I.Truhina branch of the department of physics of the sea and inland waters transformed into Research and Education Center (REC MSU IPM RAS) "Flows and structures in liquids (physics geosphere)."
</p>
<p>Students from various specialties practice at the unique installations of the complex, and perform full-fledged student research papers, go to graduate school for Problems in Mechanics Russian Academy of Sciences, has successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation.
</p>
<p>As a result, the experimentally observed and theoretical foundation received such new, previously unknown phenomena, such as:</p>
<li>establishment of spatially ordered patterns of free convection flow over point, ruled flat or heat sources in a continuously stratified fluid;</li>
<li>the formation of high-gradient layers and moving to the source of the vortices in the areas of intersection of shells beams of periodic gravitational waves in a continuously stratified fluid;</li>
<li>education gaps hanging in the attached internal waves over a horizontal cylinder;</li>
<li>mismatch of symmetry and geometry of the streamlined obstacle density: Should a circular cross section of a sphere in a homogeneous liquid is transformed into a prismatic trail (marked with corner points) in a continuously stratified fluid;</li>
<li>forming sequences of streaky structures on the obstacles and their gradual transformation into the vortex of the system;</li>
<li>the formation of spiral arms and painted surfaces on the free surface and in the thickness of the composite vortex in a homogeneous fluid;</li>
<li>separated by a generation of audio packets when struck free-falling drops of water surface.</li>

<p>A theoretical analysis of the fundamental system of equations of motion of non-homogeneous liquids singular perturbation theory methods identified a previously unknown family of fine-structure components of currents, which are described by a singularly perturbed functions. Such components do not exist only near the contact surfaces, but also thicker liquids. With the influence of viscosity associated with the formation of two different types of flow. Fine-structure components of the influence on the formation and transport of vorticity, dissipation of mechanical energy of motion, restructuring and mass transfer.
